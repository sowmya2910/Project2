# Project2
README file for Project 2, ECEN5813 Principles of Embedded Software

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this repository is to complete the assigned work for
project 2 for ECEN 5813.

SUMMARY:  Serveral functions dealing with circular buffer and UART data manipulation were created in several .c and .h files.
The Freedom KL25z was configured to a baud rate of 112500 and a clock of 48 MHz. It was then used to add and remove data from and to the circular buffer through the UART. A Statistics table with the count of each type of character checked is printed. This print condition gets active when a particular key is pressed after entering required data to be counted. This key is the Spacebar(corresponding to Dec value 32 and hex value 20). The types of characters checked are Alphabets, Numbers, Punctuations and Miscellaneous Characters. In addition to these requirements, git and GitHub was to be used by both members of the group to track changes made.

GROUP:  The code included was written and maintained by Sowmya Ramakrishnan and Vinayak Srivatsan Kovalam Mohan

DUE DATE:  Deadline for the project 2 submission is October 29, 2017 by midnight.
